Something a bit reassuring about how mild acne might clear up by itself.

## Your pharmacist can help with mild acne

If you have mild acne you can try over-the-counter (OTC) creams or gels with benzoyl peroxide. 

Benzoyl peroxide is an antiseptic that reduces the number of bacteria on the surface of the skin. It helps to reduce the number of whiteheads and blackhead and has an anti-inflammatory effect.

It should be used sparingly, as too much can irritate your skin.

Benzoyl peroxide is the only over-the-counter treatment proven to be effective. You can buy products that contain benzoyl peroxide in supermarkets and pharmacies.  

There is little proof that other OTC creams and gels that don’t have benzoyl peroxide help to treat mild acne.

!!! warning
People affected by acne often leave it too long to see a doctor because they are told it is normal. Do not put off seeking treatment if you have scarring or your acne is not getting better with an OTC gel or cream.
