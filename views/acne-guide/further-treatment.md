## Your pharmacist can help with mild acne

If you have mild acne you can try over-the-counter (OTC) creams or gels with benzoyl peroxide. 

Benzoyl peroxide is an antiseptic that reduces the number of bacteria on the surface of the skin. It helps to reduce the number of whiteheads and blackhead and has an anti-inflammatory effect.

It should be used sparingly, as too much can irritate your skin.

Benzoyl peroxide is the only over-the-counter treatment proven to be effective. You can buy products that contain benzoyl peroxide in supermarkets and pharmacies.  

There is little proof that other OTC creams and gels that don’t have benzoyl peroxide help to treat mild acne.

## See a GP if:

Severe acne can be painful and cause great distress. People with severe acne also worry about permanent scarring.  

Severe acne can be painful and cause great distress. People with severe acne also worry about permanent scarring.  

See your GP if: 
- OTC treatments haven't worked after 2-3 weeks
- your acne is severe 
- your acne has not improved or is getting worse  
- you’re worried about scarring

If your acne is making you unhappy and affecting your everyday life, your GP can recommend a treatment to help control it.

!!!

People affected by acne often leave it too long to see a doctor because they are told it is normal. Do not put off seeking treatment if you have scarring or your acne is not getting better with an OTC gel or cream. 

### What happens at your GP appointment

Your GP might ask you how long you’ve had symptoms, if there are triggers and how it is affecting your life.

They can prescribe medicines such as:

- topical retinoids
- topical antibiotics
- azelaic acid
- antibiotic tablets
- in women, the combined oral contraceptive pill
- isotretinoin tablets or gels such as Roaccutane

Some topical treatments (creams or gels) may dry or irritate the skin when you start using them. 

If your face goes red and is irritated by a lotion or cream, stop treatment for a few days and try using the treatment less often and then building up gradually.

## Treating severe acne

Your GP may decide to: 
- put you on a longer course of treatment 
- a stronger medication 
- combine your treatment with another medication, for example a cream or gel with antibiotics  
- refer you to a skin specialist/dermatologist

## Alternative and natural remedies for acne

There is little proof to show that natural remedies such as using tea tree oil and herbal remedies help to treat acne

## What causes spots and acne

Common reasons people think they get acne

- you do not get acne because you’re not washing enough. In fact, if you wash too much it can aggravate the skin and make it worse.
- what you eat or drink has little or no effect on acne
- stress doesn’t cause acne although it can make it worse

::: reveal What thrush looks like
We all have sebaceous glands that produce oil. We also shed dead skin cells. Acne happens when hormones cause these glands to produce too much oil and become plugged with skin cells. 

If the plug is close to the surface of the skin, it bulges outwards, creating a whitehead. If it is open to the skin it creates a blackhead.

Normally harmless bacteria that live on the skin can then contaminate, infect and inflame the plugged follicles, causing acne.
