## How to treat acne yourself

To reduce acne and ease discomfort:

### Do

- use a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water (hot or cold water may your acne worse)
- use skin products labelled ‘non-comedogenic’ (should not cause blackheads or whiteheads) or non-acnegenic (should not cause acne)
- use oil-free or water based make-up
- remove make up with a mild soap or a gentle cleanser and water, or with an oil-free soap solution
- avoid stress where you can - it can make your acne worse
- moisturise because some treatments for acne can dry out your skin - ask your pharmacist which products to use

### Don’t

- pick or squeeze your spots as this makes them worse and may cause scarring
- wash the area more than twice a day - washing too often can make acne worse
- scrub too hard - this can irritate the skin and make your acne worse
- put toothpaste on your spots - it can damage your skin
- sunbathe or use sunbeds to get rid of acne - there’s little proof that it helps
- believe anyone who tells you sex or masturbation makes acne worse - this isn’t true

## Your pharmacist can help with mild acne

If you have mild acne your pharmacist can recommend creams or gels. 

Ask for products with benzoyl peroxide. They’re the only ones proven to reduce the number of spots.

## Treating moderate and severe acne

Your GP can help if your acne is more severe or if it’s making you unhappy and affecting your everyday life.

Don’t put off seeing your GP. People often leave it too long because they’re told acne is normal. But some types of acne can lead to scarring.

### What happens at your appointment

Your GP will look at your acne and talk to you about: 

- how long you’ve had acne
- if there are things you know of that make it worse
- how it’s affecting your life

You can speak freely with your GP. They see people with acne all the time. 

It’s up to you if you come to the appointment on your own or with your parents. 

## Treatment from your GP

Your GP might prescribe you stronger medication than what you can get at the pharmacy, for example antibiotics.

What they prescribe will very much depend on how severe your acne is and your skin type. Sometimes they’ll use a combination of treatments, for example a cream with antibiotic tablets. 

Your GP will tell you how long to try the treatment for. If it doesn’t work, make another appointment. It might take some time to find the right treatment for you. 

Your GP might also refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist). 

## Alternative and natural remedies for acne

There is little proof to show that natural remedies such as using tea tree oil and herbal remedies help to treat acne.
