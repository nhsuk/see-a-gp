## Seeing a doctor about acne

If you’re worried about getting scars or your acne is making you unhappy, see a GP. They see people with acne all the time and will be able to help you. 

You can go on your own or bring someone with you. It’s important you feel comfortable when talking about your symptoms. 

## Mild acne

For mild acne you don’t always need to see a GP. Talk to a pharmacist first. They can recommend creams or gels. 

Ask for products with benzoyl peroxide. These are the only ones proven to reduce the number of spots. 

If these products don’t work, see your GP.

## Moderate and severe acne

It’s important to see a GP for moderate and severe acne because they can leave scars. Sometimes it can be hard to make the decision to go and see someone but try not put it off. 

The GP will ask things like: 

- how long you’ve had acne
- if there are things you know of that make it worse
- how it’s affecting your life

You can speak freely with your GP. 

### Treatments from your GP

Your GP will talk you through treatments that are suitable for your level of acne and your skin type. Together you’ll decide what to try first. 

Treating acne is not always straightforward and you might have to try different treatments. They can also take some time to work. It’s usually between 2 to 6 months before you start seeing a change. 

Make another appointment if the prescribed treatment doesn’t work within the time frame. It’s normal for people to go back to their GP for acne. 

Your GP might also refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) to help with the treatment. 

## Alternative and natural remedies for acne

There is little proof to show that natural remedies such as using tea tree oil and herbal remedies help to treat acne.
