        <li>use skin products labelled ‘non-comedogenic’ (should not cause blackheads or whiteheads) or non-acnegenic (should not cause acne)</li>
        <li>use oil-free or water based make-up</li>
        <li>remove make up with a mild soap or a gentle cleanser and water, or with an oil-free soap solution
</li>
        <li>avoid stress where you can - it can make your acne worse </li>
        <li>moisturise because some treatments for acne can dry out your skin - ask your pharmacist which products to use</li>

      <ul class="list--cross">
        <li>pick or squeeze your spots as this makes them worse and may cause scarring</li>
