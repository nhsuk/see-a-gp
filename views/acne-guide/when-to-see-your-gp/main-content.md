Severe acne can be painful and cause great distress. People with severe acne also worry about permanent scarring.  

If your acne is making you unhappy and affecting your everyday life, your GP can recommend a treatment to help control it.

People affected by acne often leave it too long to see a doctor because they are told it is normal.

Do not put off seeking treatment if you have scarring or your acne is not getting better with an OTC gel or cream. 

!!!attention
## See a GP if:

See your GP if: 
- OTC treatments haven't worked after 2-3 weeks
- your acne is severe 
- your acne has not improved or is getting worse  
- you’re worried about scarring
!!! 

### What happens at your GP appointment

Your GP might ask you how long you’ve had symptoms, if there are triggers and how it is affecting your life.

They can prescribe medicines such as:

- topical retinoids
- topical antibiotics
- azelaic acid
- antibiotic tablets
- in women, the combined oral contraceptive pill
- isotretinoin tablets or gels such as Roaccutane

Some topical treatments (creams or gels) may dry or irritate the skin when you start using them. 

If your face goes red and is irritated by a lotion or cream, stop treatment for a few days and try using the treatment less often and then building up gradually.

## Treating severe acne

Your GP may decide to: 
- put you on a longer course of treatment 
- a stronger medication 
- combine your treatment with another medication, for example a cream or gel with antibiotics  
- refer you to a skin specialist/dermatologist
