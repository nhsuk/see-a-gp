## What causes spots and acne {id="causes"}

You get spots when the tiny holes (pores) that hairs in your skin grow out of become plugged. This happens when your skin produces too much oil which mixes with dead skin cells and forms a plug. 

Bacteria that normally live on your skin can infect the plugged hole. This leads to spots. 

Why your skin produces too much oil isnâ€™t fully known. This could be because of a hormone called testosterone. During puberty your body produces more testosterone. The glands that produce the oil are very sensitive to hormones. 

Flares of acne can also be triggered by:

- medicines such as steroids, hormones and anti-epileptic drugs
- very humid air
- eating too much dairy 
- [polycystic ovarian disease](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Polycystic-ovarian-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx)

There is little evidence that any foods, such as chocolate and fast foods, cause acne.
