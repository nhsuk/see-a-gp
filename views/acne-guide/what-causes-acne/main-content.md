## What causes spots and acne {id="causes"}

You get spots when your skin pores become blocked. This happens when the skin produces too much oil. The oil mixes with dead skin cells and forms a plug. 

Bacteria can infect the blocked pore. This leads to spots. 

Why your skin produces too much oil isn’t fully known. This could be because of a hormone called testosterone. During puberty your body produces more testosterone. It’s possible that the testosterone tells the glands to produce more oil than is needed. 

Things that can make acne worse: 

- very humid air
- eating too much dairy 
- [polycystic ovarian disease](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Polycystic-ovarian-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx)
- medicines such as steroids, hormones and anti-epileptic drugs

There is little evidence that foods, such as chocolate and fast foods, cause acne.
