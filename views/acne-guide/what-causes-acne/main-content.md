## What causes spots and acne

Common reasons people think they get acne

- you do not get acne because you’re not washing enough. In fact, if you wash too much it can aggravate the skin and make it worse.
- what you eat or drink has little or no effect on acne
- stress doesn’t cause acne although it can make it worse

We all have sebaceous glands that produce oil. We also shed dead skin cells. Acne happens when hormones cause these glands to produce too much oil and become plugged with skin cells. 

If the plug is close to the surface of the skin, it bulges outwards, creating a whitehead. If it is open to the skin it creates a blackhead.

Normally harmless bacteria that live on the skin can then contaminate, infect and inflame the plugged follicles, causing acne.


There is little evidence that any foods, such as chocolate and fast foods, cause acne.

Flares of acne can also be triggered by:
- [polycystic ovarian disease](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Polycystic-ovarian-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx)
- medicines such as steroids, hormones and anti-epileptic drugs
- high humidity
- a diet high in dairy products
