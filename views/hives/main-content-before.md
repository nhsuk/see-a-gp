## How you can treat hives yourself

Hives can settle down or go away on their own without treatment. 

## Your pharmacist can help with hives  

To relieve any pain or itchiness you can use a cooling cream such as calamine on the rash or take [antihistamine tablets](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Antihistamines/Pages/Introduction.aspx).

You can buy them over the counter at supermarkets and pharmacies. Some antihistamines are not good for adults and children with certain conditions, and some can make you feel sleepy.

## What causes hives?
Common triggers of hives include:

- an allergic reaction – to food, pollen, plants,  insect bites and stings, latex, dust mites or chemicals
- physical triggers – such as pressure to the skin, changes in temperature, sunlight, exercise or water
- medicines – some medicine can cause hives as a side effect – including antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and aspirin
- infections – which can range from a cold to the very serious, such as HIV 
- emotional stress 

There are many types of hives, and the causes of hives are different depending on what you're reacting to.

### Avoiding triggers 

If you know what triggers your hives or makes the rash worse, avoiding the trigger can help keep your symptoms under control.

If you think you’re reacting to a medication that you're taking, speak to your GP who may be able to prescribe another one for your condition. 

If your hives are heat related, try to work and sleep in a cool room and wear loose-fitting, lightweight clothes.
