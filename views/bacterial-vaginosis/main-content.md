::: reveal  If you’re unsure it’s bacterial vaginosis

The symptoms of BV are similar to:

- [thrush](/thrush/) 
- [vaginal discharge](/vaginal-discharge/) 
:::

## What happens at your appointment

Your GP or sexual health clinic will want confirm it's BV and rule out a sexually transmitted infection (STI). 

- you'll be asked about your symptoms
- a doctor or nurse will look at your vagina
- a cotton bud may be wiped over the discharge inside your vagina to test for other infections 

This won't hurt, but may feel uncomfortable.

The results will take a day or two if you go to a sexual health clinic and around a week if you go to your GP.

## Treatment for bacterial vaginosis

BV is treated with antibiotic tablets, such as metronidazole, or antibiotic gel. 

If you are pregnant, it is safe to use treatment, even in the first 12 weeks.

There are treatments available at supermarkets and pharmacies that help relieve the symptoms, but they don't get rid of BV.

 Partners don’t need treatment.
 
### Recurrent bacterial vaginosis

It's common for BV to return. More than half of women treated for BV find their symptoms return, usually within three months. 

If you keep getting BV you may be referred to a specialist in STIs for further treatment.

## What causes bacterial vaginosis

Bacterial vaginosis happens when there's a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina. What causes this to happen isn’t fully known.

BV is not an STI, but women who are sexually active and have had a change of partner are more likely to have it, including women in same-sex relationships.

## Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy

If you develop BV in pregnancy, there is a small risk of complications, such as premature birth or miscarriage. 

However, BV causes no problems in the majority of pregnancies

## Things you can do yourself

Avoiding anything that may upset the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina may help.
