## Check if you have thrush

Thrush symptoms in women:

*  white discharge (like cottage cheese) which doesnâ€™t usually smell
*  itching and irritation around the vagina 
*  soreness and stinging during sex or when you pee

Thrush symptoms in men:

* irritation, burning and redness around the head of the penis and under the foreskin
* a white discharge - it may look like cottage cheese
* an unpleasant smell
* difficulty pulling back the foreskin

Thrush can affect other areas of skin, such as the armpits, groin and between the fingers. This causes a red, itchy or painful rash that scales over with white or yellow discharge.
